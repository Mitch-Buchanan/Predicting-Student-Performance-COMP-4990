This file analyzes categorical features' influence on exam scores in two steps:

1. Impact Analysis:
  - Calculates mean scores and statistics for each category
  - Identifies significant features (>1 point difference between categories)
  - Example: Parental_Involvement with Â±1.73 point impact is significant
  - Features with <1 point impact are excluded from score generation

2. Baseline Analysis:
  - For significant features, determines appropriate baseline category
  - Uses criteria: highest frequency and/or closest to overall mean
  - Example: For Parental_Involvement, Medium is baseline (most common and closest to mean)
  - Baselines are used to calculate score modifiers in synthetic data generation

The results from both analyses help generate synthetic data that maintains realistic 
relationships between features and exam scores from the original dataset.

### ANALYSIS ###
'''
We should only include categorical features that show meaningful differences in exam scores from the analysis we did.
Looking at the results, the following features have minimal impact on exam scores (difference less than 1 point), so we should EXclude them from score generation:


Motivation_Level: 0.95 points

Family_Income: 0.99 points

Teacher_Quality: 0.93 points

Extracurricular_Activities: 0.51 points

Internet_Access: 0.75 points

School_Type: 0.08 points

Gender: 0.01 points


So, we should include features that have differences greater than 1 point in exam scores because they show more significant impact.
Including features with very small effects (like Gender with 0.01 point difference) wouldn't meaningfully affect the generated scores.
